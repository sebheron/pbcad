I think the most interesting part of this project is not the language itself but the integration with VPR.
I recommend anyone with an interest to play with VPR (fork this project) and see what they can simulate, copasi is fully integrated.
There's a miriad of things I missed off, and there's a new version of libsbolj coming out (might be out already when you read this).
