# Programming-Biology

## CS final year project.

I had planned to make this public for a while, but had held off (didn't want to get told off by my lecturers).
This is a Java implementation of VPR (The virtual parts repository) as a new programming language for building quick-and-fast genetic circuits.
Hopefully this will interest some in Bioinformatics and you can get a gage on how easy it is to build these systems.
